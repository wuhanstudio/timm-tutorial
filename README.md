# TIMM Tutorial

> TIMM (Torch Image Models) provides SOTA computer vision models.

As deep learning models and datasets grow, it is more common to fine-tune pretrained models than train a model from scratch.

### Vision Transformer

```
python timm_vit_train.py
```

### ResNet50
```
python timm_resnet_train.py
```
