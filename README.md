# TIMM Tutorial

> TIMM (Torch IMage Models) provides SOTA computer vision models.

As the size of deep learning models and datasets grows, it is more common to fine-tune pretrained models than train a model from scratch.

### Vision Transformer

```
python timm_vit_train.py
```

### ResNet50
```
python timm_resnet_train.py
```
